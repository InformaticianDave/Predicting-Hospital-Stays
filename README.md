# Predicting-Hospital-Stays
Background to the study
Novel Coronavirus:  The pandemic has prompted concerns about one of the most neglected areas: Healthcare Management. While data science has several applications in healthcare management, patient length of stay is one of the most important parameters to watch and forecast if one want to increase the efficiency of healthcare administration in a hospital.
At the time of admission, this metric helps hospitals identify patients with a high risk of LOS (patients who will remain longer). Once identified, patients at high risk for length of stay (LOS) can have their treatment plan improved to minimize LOS and reduce staff/visitor infection risk. With addition, previous knowledge of LOS can benefit in logistics such as the allocation of rooms and beds.
Assume you have been employed as a Data Scientist by Ketchup Clinic, a non-profit organization committed to the professional and optimum management of hospital operations.
The objective is to precisely estimate the Length of Stay for each patient on an individual basis so that hospitals may use this information for optimal resource allocation and improved performance. The length of stay is separated into eleven distinct categories ranging from 0 to 10 days to over 100 days.
